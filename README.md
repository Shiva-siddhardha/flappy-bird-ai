# 🐦 Flappy Bird AI using Neural Network & Genetic Algorithm (No ML Libraries)

This project trains an AI to play the Flappy Bird game using a **neural network** and a **genetic algorithm**, all built from scratch in Python without using any machine learning libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Built completely from scratch
- No TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ML libraries used
- Simple neural network + genetic algorithm
- Visualization using Pygame

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each bird has a **neural network** with fixed structure (topology).
- A **genetic algorithm** evolves the neural network weights across generations.
- The AI learns to survive longer by flying through pipes.
